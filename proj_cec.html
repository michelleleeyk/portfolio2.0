        <h2>Website Redesign for the Climate Entrepreneurs Club</h2>
        <p> Redesigned the website of the Climate Entrepreneurs Club such that it more accurately portrayed
            the club's
            brand image and goals. A month after the launch, the new website had a conversion rate of 15%,
            attracting
            30 new members. Ease of obtaining information, intuitive navigation and the visual language of the
            website were prioritised throughout the process.</p>

    <h3>How I Fulfiled/Enhanced the Functions of the Website</h3>
    <p><span class="emphasise">Function 1: To provide value to existing club members</span><br>
        I created two new sections on the website - a resources page that provides useful information for budding
        climate entrepreneurs and a jobs board that advertises internships at our partner start-ups.</p>
    <img src="assets/pro_cec/cec_pages.png">
    <p><span class="emphasise">Function 2: To give prospective members an overview of the club and attract
            members</span><br>
        To encourage new member sign-ups, I emphasised the "JOIN US" button and
        placed it strategically on the navigation bar on top. Previously, the button was only on the front page and can
        be easily missed among a paragraph of text. </p>
    <p><span class="emphasise">Function 3: To demonstrate the club's activity to potential sponsors</span><br>
        I created an section that displays the upcoming events on our home page. Since the club is highly active on
        social media, I highlighted this by including our recent posts on Instagram in the website footer.</p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>Upon analysis and gathering feedback from the
            committee members, we came to a conclusion that the visual language of the website did not align with
            our club image. Thus, the branding of the club was analysed before any design decisions were made.<br><br>

        <p>To communicate friendliness, flat illustrations were used throughout the website. A consistent and
            clean
            layout was used and the content of the website was organised more effectively. </p>
